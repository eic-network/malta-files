# malta-files

Journalists working with EIC.network dug into hundreds of thousands of
documents that show how Malta operates a tax system where companies pay
the lowest tax on profits in the EU. Part of the data that was used for
this research is the public Malta Registry of Companies.

We have re-arranged, cleaned and made searchable in new ways the public
information contained in the register.

For more information about Malta Files investigation, see : https://eic.network/projects/malta-files 

Keep in mind that the data we make available is only for information
purposes and does not indicate any illegal activity. For any current and
official status go to the Malta Registry of Companies here
